	<h2>1)Stay organized</h2>
	
	<p>It’s so much easier to become frustrated when you’re disorganized. Try to keep a routine and keep your workplace clean and organized. If you have a routine, you’ll be less likely to procrastinate and leave off all your work until the last minute. In other words, if you have a routine, you’ll be a lot less stressed out!</p>

	<h2> 1) Sleep</h2>
	<p>I know it’s tempting to stay up all night and watch Netflix…</p> <br>

	<p><strong>…but sleep smart!</strong> Sleep is integral for healthy brain function. Although it’s very difficult to maintain eight full hours of sleep during the school year, it’s important to try to get as much sleep as is possible. Spend less time vegetating on social media and more time catching those z’s! </p>
	<h2>3) Stay Active</h2>
	<p>Physical exercise is essential for a healthy lifestyle. It’s also a great way to de-stress. Try doing some jumping jacks in between study sessions—or going for a brisk walk. Yoga is  also great ways to relieve tension! Sign up for a  weight lifting class or buy a yoga mat and learn online! Also, you can follow health and wellness sites on social media like Men's Health and Women's Health, or download an exercise app on your phone that keeps track of your steps which could motivate you to do some exercises at home.</p>

	<h2>4) Study in a group</h2>
	<p>Oftentimes, studying with friends or people you are comfortable with is optimal for relieving stress. You can know you’re not suffering alone, and you can try try all sorts of group study methods. Try quizzing each other, discussing key topics, and asking them your questions—if you conduct the study session right, it can be very fun and very productive.</p>

	<h2>5) Laugh!</h2>
	<p>Laughing really is the best medicine. Or, at least, it’s excellent at de-stressing! Scientific studies have proven that laughing eases stress and lowers blood pressure. So, even if you’re really not in the mood for it, laugh! Watch some funny videos on Youtube or remember a funny memory, and you’ll be guaranteed to feel a lot less stressed.</p>

	<h2>6) Eat Healthy Meals</h2>
	<p>Eating definitely helps in stressful situations.  Certain foods, like fruits and vegetables are scientifically proven to contain happiness-boosting nutrients and ingredients. Why is eating important for students? Research has shown that students are able to learn better when they're well nourished, and eating healthy meals has been linked to higher grades, better memory and alertness, and faster information processing. So the next time you’re feeling down, try chomping down on some some good nutritious food!</p>

	<h2>7) Change up your environment </h2>
	<p>It might seem daunting to go to high school events, but really—do it! Football games, dances, movie nights, fundraisers, etc. are great ways to meet new people, get to know your school better, and have a lot of fun. I know lots of people who dearly regret not getting involved during freshman year because they thought school activities were lame or because they were too scared to try them out. Freshman year is the year where you’ll have the most free time, so make use of it!</p>

	<h2>8) Stop wasting time</h2>
	<p>If you study earlier and not later and start becoming more productive, you’ll actually spend a lot less time getting your work done and more time to relax. Rather than half-heartedly studying while watching TV, get away from your distractions and just get your work over with. You’ll spend a lot less time stressing over looming deadlines and a lot more time relaxing. Try downloading tools which track your internet usage, so you can see which websites you spend the most time on. Or try pitching into this list of time management strategies.</p>

	<h2>9) Don't take on more than you can handle</h2>
	<p>Learn to keep your priorities straight and don’t overburden yourself with commitments. Don’t try to cram a whole bunch of activities in your schedule if you can’t handle it, and don’t always feel obligated to dedicated all your time to other people. You are important, too—learn to say “no” if you know you already have too much on your plate!</p>

	<h2>10) Speak out loud</h2>
	<p>Talk about your stress with someone. Really, it helps. Find an understanding friend or family member to talk about your problems with (preferably someone who won’t make you more stressed!). If you feel like there’s no one who understands, there are tons of counseling hotlines like the Georgia Crisis and Access Line, which will help you for free. There number is 1-800-715-4225.  Or the <strong>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</strong>.  There number is 1-800-273-8255. These and other services can provide confidential (<em>private</em>) support for people in distress. </p>
